# Karpathy Coding Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes, derived from Andrej Karpathy's observations on LLM coding pitfalls. These principles bias toward caution over speed — for trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

# Performance Rules

## Context Window Management

Avoid last 20% of context window for:

- Large-scale refactoring
- Feature implementation spanning multiple files
- Debugging complex interactions

## Algorithm Efficiency

Before implementing:

- [ ] Consider time complexity
- [ ] Avoid O(n^2) when O(n log n) possible
- [ ] Use appropriate data structures
- [ ] Cache expensive computations

# Coding Style Rules

## Immutability (CRITICAL)

ALWAYS create new objects, NEVER mutate:

```javascript
// WRONG: Mutation
function updateUser(user, name) {
  user.name = name  // MUTATION!
  return user
}

// CORRECT: Immutability
function updateUser(user, name) {
  return { ...user, name }
}
```

## File Organization

MANY SMALL FILES > FEW LARGE FILES:

- High cohesion, low coupling
- 200-400 lines typical, 800 max
- Extract utilities from large components
- Organize by feature/domain, not by type

## Error Handling

ALWAYS handle errors comprehensively:

```typescript
try {
  const result = await riskyOperation()
  return result
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Operation failed:', error)
  throw new Error('User-friendly error message')
}
```

## Input Validation

ALWAYS validate user input:

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

const schema = z.object({
    email: z.string().email(),
    age: z.number().int().min(0).max(150)
});

const validated = schema.parse(input);
```

## Code Quality Checklist

Before marking work complete:

- [ ] Code is readable and well-named
- [ ] Functions are small (<50 lines)
- [ ] Files are focused (<800 lines)
- [ ] No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No console.log statements
- [ ] No hardcoded values
- [ ] Immutable patterns used

# Testing Rules

## Minimum Test Coverage: 80%

Test Types (ALL required):

1. **Unit Tests** - Individual functions, utilities, components
2. **Integration Tests** - API endpoints, database operations
3. **E2E Tests** - Critical user flows

## Test-Driven Development

MANDATORY workflow:

1. Write test first (RED)
2. Run test - it should FAIL
3. Write minimal implementation (GREEN)
4. Run test - it should PASS
5. Refactor (IMPROVE)
6. Verify coverage (80%+)

## Edge Cases to Test

Every function must be tested with:

- [ ] Null/undefined inputs
- [ ] Empty arrays/strings
- [ ] Invalid types
- [ ] Boundary values (min/max)
- [ ] Error conditions

## Test Quality Checklist

- [ ] Tests are independent (no shared state)
- [ ] Test names describe behavior
- [ ] Mocks used for external dependencies
- [ ] Both happy path and error paths tested
- [ ] No flaky tests

# Security Rules

## Mandatory Security Checks

Before ANY commit:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] Authentication/authorization verified
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive data

## Secret Management

```typescript
// NEVER: Hardcoded secrets
const apiKey = "sk-proj-xxxxx"

// ALWAYS: Environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY
if (!apiKey) throw new Error('API_KEY not configured')
```

## Security Response Protocol

If security issue found:

1. STOP immediately
2. Fix CRITICAL issues before continuing
3. Rotate any exposed secrets
4. Review entire codebase for similar issues
